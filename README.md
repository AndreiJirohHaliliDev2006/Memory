# Memories of Evolution X

**Why did I create this repository?** (I referred to Akito Mizukito)

I wanted to do something creative, something no one in the community has ever done.

## Historical Information

**Evolution X, Founded by Joey Huab (Stallix) and currently has 2 co. founders, Akito Mizukito (RealAkito) and Anierin Bliss (AnierinB)**


### How did Evolution X get founded?

I (In here, referred to Joey Huab) wanted to have my own version of a Pixel ROM but Pixel Experience beat me to it. So I applied for official maintainership. After getting kicked, I kept doing unofficial builds until I said I should build my own.

### How did I get kicked from maintaining official Pixel Experience?

Putting VoLTE icon support into official build.

### What we planned to do next?

We're supposed to bringup Android Q for Evolution X (Evolution X Q) once Google publicly release the source codes!
